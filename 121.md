<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of if you think you understand something, pair programming is an invaluable industry skill that you need to practice</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br/>
Perhaps, it seems obvious what you need to do, but ensure you know what you&rsquo;re doing by learning through the examples below. </p>

<p><br/>
Let’s say we have two students, Kristen and Stuart. Stuart is trying to understand a few things that Kristen wants to help with. Here’s how it’d break down:</p>

<p>Kristen is not allowed to touch the computer; instead, they need to make sure that Stuart goes through The ALX Framework. </p>

<p><br/>
Kristen should try to prevent Stuart from searching Google if the answer can be found in the man or documentations provided on the Intranet.</p>

<p><br/>
If Stuart struggles too much solving one task, Kristen is allowed to use the computer and code the solution in front of Stuart, and explain the thought process. </p>

<p><br/>
Kristen should make sure that Stuart understands everything, though. When done, Kristen deletes all the files containing the solution, and Stuart tries again.</p>

<p><br/>
<strong>If you’re trying to help someone:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>When explaining a concept, make sure you give examples to illustrate. Try to use whiteboards as much as you can.</p></li>
<li><p>Be patient and understand that people think differently about the same problem. Sometimes, something will seem obvious to you, but to someone else, it may not be. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most of the time, if you explain the same concept twice and your peer doesn’t get it, it’s because you didn’t explain it well enough :) It’s your fault, not theirs.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Try to rephrase, break it into smaller pieces, find new examples</p></li>
<li><p>To ensure someone understands a concept, it is not enough to ask “do you understand”. You should start with this question, yes, but you should ask them to solve a similar small task using the same concept. A good way to test is to ask a knowledgeable peer to explain it again to you.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><br/>
For Instance, if [following our prior example] Kristen explains permissions / modes, the questions should be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do you understand?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes</p></li>
<li><p>Great! Explain it back to me now please :)</p></li>
<li><p>…</p></li>
<li><p>Great, explain what does rwxr-xr&ndash; mean</p></li>
<li><p>…</p></li>
<li><p>Great, so what would be the octal notation of rwxr&mdash;-x?</p></li>
<li><p>…</p></li>
<li><p>Great! what would be the permissions of a directory with a mode of 755?</p></li>
<li><p>…</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Pair programming Continued …</h3>

<p>When a peer receiving support completes all tasks demonstrated by the peer helping, they should work together on the remaining tasks (including the advanced tasks). Same rules apply:
* Read the documentation</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don’t code before you have a potential solution</p></li>
<li><p>Explain out loud your thought process</p></li>
<li><p>Etc..</p></li>
</ul>

<p><br/>
For each task, switch the students who is typing. The student needing support should start. When switching, the new student needs to code the same task again. <strong>No copy-paste.</strong></p>

<p>Example: There are 3 tasks remaining: T0, T1, T2, and Kristen and Stuart are still our examples of collaborating students.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stuart and Kristen solve all tasks together, but:</p></li>
<li><p>Stuart starts typing for T0 and when done pushes on his github.</p></li>
<li><p>Then Kristen types again the solution of T0 and pushes to her github.</p></li>
<li><p>Then Kristen types for T1, pushes on her github.</p></li>
<li><p>Then Stuart types again the solution of T1, pushes, and starts T2.</p></li>
<li><p>When Stuart and Kristen found the solution for T2, Stuart pushes to his github.</p></li>
<li><p>Then Kristen types the solution again and pushes on her github.</p></li>
</ul>

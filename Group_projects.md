<h2>Teamwork Makes the Dream Work</h2>

<p>As you well know, collaboration is incredibly important - at school, in tech, and life. Even though we <em>know</em> it&rsquo;s important, it can be easy to find our own, individual rhythm of productivity at the expense of our partner&rsquo;s (or partners&rsquo;) participation.</p>

<p>Inversely, you may encounter a project where your partner <em>wants</em> to take a backseat, and would prefer for the work to be done without their contributions. </p>

<p>These modes of project management (along with their derivatives) disservice your understanding and invaluable life skill of bringing another up to speed. </p>

<p>In the spirit of wanting to hold you accountable, your group projects will include a <em>heavily</em> weighted expectation of equal contribution. </p>

<h2>&ldquo;What does <em>that</em> mean?&rdquo;</h2>

<p>It means that both partners need to have equal as possible git commits to the master branch as possible; the farther from &ldquo;equal&rdquo;, the overall score of the project will decrease.</p>

<p>Equal as possible == no more than a 40/60 contribution from the respective partner&rsquo;s user name (this will be different in the off chance of a third member)</p>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>We realize this may prove a challenge at times, and that&rsquo;s ok! It&rsquo;s an education in and of itself that will prepare you for your future careers. Remember to follow the Framework, and it&rsquo;ll all work out.</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>
